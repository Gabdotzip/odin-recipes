    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Truffle mac and cheese is one of my favorite things to make when there's a
      chill in the air. It's great for cheese lovers, like myself, and works
      well at dinner parties. The leftovers are good too! Truffle oil is one of
      the best culinary purchases I've made. One little bottle has lasted me a
      year and can be used with so many things. Top this dish with a pinch of
      truffle salt if desired.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package cavatappi (corkscrew macaroni)</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>5 ½ cups milk, divided</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups shredded smoked Gouda cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon truffle oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a large pot over medium-low
        heat. Whisk flour into melted butter until mixture has a thick,
        paste-like consistency, about 30 seconds. Slowly whisk in 2 cups milk
        until smooth. Stir in remaining milk, increase the heat to medium-high,
        and cook, whisking constantly, until thick and almost boiling, 5 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Gouda, Cheddar, Swiss, and 1 cup Parmesan; stir until cheeses melt
        and sauce is smooth. Fold in cooked cavatappi until coated. Pour mixture
        into the prepared baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs together in a
        small bowl; sprinkle over cavatappi mixture, then drizzle truffle oil
        over top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and topping is
        golden, about 30 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
